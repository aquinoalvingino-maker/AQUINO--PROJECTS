intervention_service.py
------------------------
Persists which AUF Early Intervention Policy checklist items have been
completed for each student (see utils/intervention_policy.py for the
policy content itself). Backed by the `intervention_log` table, keyed
by Student_ID rather than a foreign key to students.id, since the
students table is replaced wholesale on every dataset upload - this
keeps a teacher's tracked progress intact across re-uploads as long as
the same Student_ID reappears.
